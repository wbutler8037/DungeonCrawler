# DungeonCrawler
A simple text-adventure game I've been working on from scratch.

Required Libraries:
 * Tkinter
 * Pickle
 * Pillow

To install, just have Python 3.6, clone the repo, and checkout the Items branch. Then you should be able to run `filethatruns.py` and it should work. 

**THIS GAME IS STILL VERY MUCH IN DEVELOPMENT.**  
There are a lot of bugs:
  * Monsters can walk through each other
  * Attacking is still not how I want it to be

I work on this in my spare time, so any updates will be sporadic at best. 

I am working in the Items branch for now, but hopefully this will change once I actually figure out how I want the tile structure to go. 

**Update Log**
 * walking is fixed!
 * DOORS ARE FIXED! *(that was more because I was glad to be done than any kind of pride)*
