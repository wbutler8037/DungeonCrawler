A simple text-adventure game I've been working on from scratch.

To install, just have Python 3.6, clone the repo, and checkout the Items branch. Then you should be able to run filethatruns.py and it should work. 

THIS GAME IS STILL VERY MUCH IN DEVELOPMENT. 
There are a lot of bugs:
  * Monsters can walk through each other
  * Doors don't work
  * Attacking is still not how I want it to be

I work on this in my spare time, so any updates will be sporadic at best. 

I am working in the Items branch for now, but hopefully this will change once I actually figure out how I want the tile structure to go.
