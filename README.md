# DungeonCrawler
A simple text-adventure game I've been working on from scratch.

Required Libraries:
    * Tkinter
    * Pickle
    * Pillow

To install, just have Python 3.6, and clone the repo. Then you should be able to run `filethatruns.py` and it should work.

**This is the list of things I plan to add**
    * Items in general
    * Randomly generating monsters(definitely) and random maps(?)
    * An actual storyline, instead of just debugging feedback
    * Whatever else I thing of! ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

I work on this in my spare time, so any updates will be sporadic at best.

**Update Log**  
    * Movement engine fully functional  
    * Save/Load functionality still exists, just added a bugfix  
    * Attacking works again
