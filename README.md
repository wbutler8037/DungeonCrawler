# DungeonCrawler
A simple text-adventure game I've been working on from scratch.

Required Libraries:  
    * Tkinter  
    * Pickle  
    * Pillow  

Also uses Consolas font  

To install, just have Python 3.6 and clone the repo. Then you should be able to run `filethatruns.py` and it should work.

**This is the list of things I plan to add**  
    * More types of potions  
    * Randomly generation of monsters, and maybe maps  
    * An actual storyline, instead of just debugging feedback  
    * Whatever else I thing of! ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

I work on this in my spare time, so any updates will be sporadic at best.

**Update Log**  
    * Movement engine fully functional  
    * Save/Load functionality still exists, just added a bugfix  
    * Attacking works again  
    * Can take items from chests and remove chests when empty  
    * Items work, both consumable and equippable  
    * Can drop items  
    * Items can be randomly generated
