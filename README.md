# DungeonCrawler
A simple text-adventure game I've been working on from scratch.

Required Libraries:
    * Tkinter
    * Pickle
    * Pillow

To install, just have Python 3.6, clone the repo, and checkout the Items branch. Then you should be able to run `filethatruns.py` and it should work.

**This is the list of things I plan to add**
    * Items in general
    * Randomly generating monsters(definitely) and maps(?)
    * An actual storyline, instead of just debugging feedback
    * Whatever else I thing of! ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

I work on this in my spare time, so any updates will be sporadic at best.

I am working in the Items branch for now, but hopefully this will change once I actually figure out how I want the tile structure to go.

**Update Log**
    * Movement engine fully functional
    * Save/Load functionality still exists, just added a bugfix
    * Attacking works again
